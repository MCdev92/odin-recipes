        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>This stunning ramen dish gets its incredible depth from black garlic—or garlic aged under special conditions, softening it and transforming its piquancy into a robust, molasses-like sweetness. Its sweet and earthy notes infuse our noodles and broth, complementing hearty shiitakes and velvety soft-boiled eggs. Green beans, blanched to heighten their verdant flavor, add an element of satisfying crispness. We’re seasoning the dish with furikake (a Japanese condiment typically made of crushed, dried seaweed and sesame seeds) and—as a garnish for the eggs—pure, delicate sea salt.</p>

        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook & peel the eggs:</li><p>Heat a medium pot of salted water to boiling on high. Once boiling, carefully add the eggs and cook for exactly 6 minutes. Drain thoroughly and rinse under cold water for 30 seconds to 1 minute to stop the cooking process. Refill the pot with salted water and heat to boiling on high. When cool enough to handle, carefully peel the cooked eggs. Set aside in a warm place.</p>
            <li>Prepare the ingredients:</li><p>While the eggs cook, wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut off and discard the mushroom stems; thinly slice the caps. Peel and mince the black garlic and ginger. Cut off and discard the root ends of the scallions; thinly slice the scallions on an angle, separating the white bottoms and green tops. Snap off and discard the stem ends of the green beans; carefully slice in half lengthwise.</p>
            <li>Brown the mushrooms:</li><p>In a large, high-sided pan (or pot), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, 4 to 6 minutes, or until browned and crispy.</p>
            <li>Make the broth:</li><p>Add the black garlic, ginger,white bottoms of the scallions and sesame oil to the pan of mushrooms. Cook, stirring occasionally, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until fragrant. Add the ponzu sauce, soy glaze and 3 cups of water. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, 4 to 6 minutes, or until thoroughly combined. Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
            <li>Blanch the green beans:</li><p>While the broth simmers, fill a medium bowl with ice water and set aside. Add the green beans to the pot of boiling water and cook 3 to 4 minutes, or until bright green and slightly softened. Using a slotted spoon, carefully transfer the cooked green beans to the bowl of ice water, leaving the pot of water boiling. Let stand until the green beans are completely cool, then drain thoroughly.</p>
            <li>Cook the noodles & plate your dish:</li><p>While the green beans cool, add the noodles to the same pot of boiling water, stirring gently to separate. Cook 2 to 3 minutes, or until tender. Drain thoroughly and rinse under warm water to prevent sticking. Divide the drained noodles and broth between 2 bowls. Halve the peeled eggs; season with pepper and as much of the Jacobsen sea salt as you’d like. Top the noodles with the seasoned eggs and blanched green beans. Garnish with the green tops of the scallions and furikake. Enjoy!</p>
